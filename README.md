## Libraries Used

- **@dnd-kit/core**, **@dnd-kit/modifiers**:  
  These libraries are used for drag-and-drop interactions. The `@dnd-kit/core` package is essential because it handles the core logic of drag-and-drop interactions. Without it, you would need to implement your own drag-and-drop logic, which would require significant development effort and complexity.

- **tailwindcss**, **@tailwindcss/vite**:  
  Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework used for styling the UI. It accelerates UI development by providing pre-built classes for common styles.

- **react**, **react-dom**:  
  These libraries are used for UI development and rendering.

- **react-router-dom**:  
  This library is used for handling client-side routing in the application.
